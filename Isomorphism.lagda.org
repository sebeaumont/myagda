* Imports

The idea is to eat our own dogfood here as far as possible.

#+begin_src agda2
import Naturals

#+end_src
* Function Composition

#+begin_src agda2
_∘_ : ∀ {A B C : Set} → (B → C) → (A → B) → (A → C)
g ∘ f = λ x → g (f x)
#+end_src

* Extensionality

Seem a bit weird defintion; I mean even over the Nats how can we be sure that
two functions produce the same output (apart from running them over all inputs
from the domain)? Doesn't seem very constructive to me.

This is the converse of =cong-app= as we saw earlier [[file:Equality.lagda.org::66][definition]]
