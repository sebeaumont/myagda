* Negation

As we encountered briefly in the previous chapter where we introduced the
logical concept of falsehood or bottom (⊥) if, given a proposition =A=, we
wish to say that it cannot hold (or equivalently that it is false); we say
that its assertion is absurd.

#+begin_src agda2
¬_ : Set → Set
¬ A = A → ⊥

infix 3 ¬_
#+end_src

A contradiction can be expressed as saying if both =¬A= and =A= hold then we
may conclude that =⊥= holds; which, of course, it can't.

#+begin_src agda2
¬-elim : ∀ {A : Set}
  → ¬ A
  → A
    ---
  → ⊥
¬-elim ¬x x = ¬x x 
#+end_src

Note that =¬-elim= is just a special case of =→-elim=. 

#+begin_src agda2
¬¬-intro : ∀ {A : Set}
  → A
    -----
  → ¬ ¬ A
¬¬-intro x ¬x = ¬x x 
#+end_src

In /classical/ logic we have that =A= is equivalent to =¬¬A= but in
/intuitionistic/ logic, as used in Agda, we may only state that =A= implies
=¬¬A=, but not that =¬¬A → A=.

Here =x= is evidence of =A= therefore assuming =¬A= leads to a contradiction and
hence =¬¬A= must hold.

#+begin_src agda2
¬¬-intro' : ∀ {A : Set}
  → A
    -----
  → ¬ ¬ A
¬¬-intro' x ¬x = ¬-elim ¬x x
#+end_src

We cannot constructively show that =¬¬A → A= , but we can show that =\neg¬¬A=
implies =¬A=.

#+begin_src agda2
¬¬¬-elim : ∀ {A : Set}
  → ¬ ¬ ¬ A
    -------
  → ¬ A
¬¬¬-elim ¬¬¬x = λ x → ¬¬¬x (¬¬-intro x)

  More explanation required here these are not easy to read.

I think it is helpful to read these negations, say =¬¬A= as: /it is not true
that =A= is false or it is not proven that =A= is false,/ in order to see the
logical meaning of these propositions and their proofs.

Intuitionist logic seems weaker than classical logic; saying that: /it is
not proven or known if =A= is false/; says nothing about =A= being true. This
requirement for us to have /constructed/ an a witness of =A= being true rather
than the dichotomy of the /excluded middle/ (EM), (or more fundamentally
/double negation/ (DN) as outlined above), is essense of the intuitionistic
position, (but AFAIK not necessarily that of the /contructivist/ who takes
this further into a requirement for finite procedures for exhibiting
infinite structures; but I'd need to study this further, Brouwer was the
father and I've so far only looked at Bishop who seems to take this
seriously indeed). I really think the /logicists/ represented in the work of
Bertrand Russell and the /formalists/ led by David Hilbert missed an
opportunity to fulfill all their ambitions by cooperating on at least the
overlaps or agreements they all shared. At least we are now putting that
straight and the /classical/ versus the /constructive/ arguments seem
unimportant now that mathematics, logic and computation are at the
crossroads of /trinitarianism/ and the aspirations of homotopy type theory
and the univalent foundations programme take type theory even closer to
practical formal mathematics.
