Following these great courses:

Mainly the first part of:

Wadler, Philip, Wen Kokke, and Jeremy G. Siek.
/Programming Language Foundations in Agda./
Available at https://plfa.inf.ed.ac.uk/22.08/. 2022.

With much practical help from:

Jesper Cockx - /Programming and Proving in Agda./
[[https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-lecture-notes/blob/master/agda.pdf][https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-lecture-notes/blob/master/agda.pdf]]

And some ideas and inspiration (as well as convincing me that unicode
ligagtures and symbols are good for readability if used with sparsity
and taste :)

Conor McBride - /CS410 Advanced Functional Programming/
